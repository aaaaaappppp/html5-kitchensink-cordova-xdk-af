<h2>This is defer.html</h2>
<p>
    This was loaded via deferred loading by setting attribute <b>data-defer="defer.html"</b> in the link.
    <br><br>
    This allows you to separate out your panels into individual files and load them after $.ui.ready is called.
    <br><br>
    This can help speed up the loading time of your app by loading the panels asynchronously.
