<h2>This is panel.html</h2>
<p>
    This was loaded via AJAX by setting attribute <b>data-persist-ajax="true"</b> and setting the <b>href="panel.html"</b> in the link. The content is inserted into it's own div and it now exists as a panel.
    <br><br>
    Setting <b>data-refresh-ajax="true"</b> will force a refresh of the content for the div based off the link. The panel is still kept in the DOM, but the content is updated.
    <br><br>
    Setting <b>title</b> attribute in the link will make it the panel header title.
